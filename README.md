# The Navigation Router for React

The folk at \newline asked me to write a course about [the Navigation router for React](https://grahammendick.github.io/navigation/). A couple of weeks later they bailed on me, claiming they couldn't monetise it. By that time, I'd already sent them the complete course outline and written most of the code samples. Seeing as making money for \newline was never my primary concern, I decided to complete the course and open source it instead.
